# AdaJS

Functional Discord.js bot framework

This repo does _not_ currently include a license.  
I will add an MIT license eventually, when I consider it ready for external participation. That will probably be when it's closer to a decent MVP. Currently this is just a personal project and I'm paying zero effort in keeping it clean. Console.logs are everywhere as of writing this
